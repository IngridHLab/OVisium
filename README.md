### Analysis of 10X Visium Spatial data

### 1. SpaceRanger and Loupe Browser

`spaceRanger count` default output includes feature-barcode matrices (gene x UMI counts) in tsv.gz or h5 format, a cloup file which can be opened in the *Loupe Browser* and visualize the analysis result ex. graph-based clustering and differential gene expression spatially, and a web_summary.html file to overview the QC matrices of the analysis. Manually annotatioin based on morphology can be exported and integrated to the *Seurat* analysis.

*SpaceRanger* also provide a pipeline called `spaceranger aggr` to allow user to aggregate multiple capture areas. The command takes a CSV file specifying a list of output files from individual samples and additional categories information for *Loupe Browser* to view or subset.

| library_id |        molecule_h5        |      cloupe_file       |  spatial_folder  |  sample_info   | slide_info |   seq_info   |
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|    PO20    | /path/to/molecule_info.h5 | /path/to/cloupe.cloupe | /path/to/spatial | BRCA_Fimbrial  | V10T06-110 | CTG_2021_075 |
|   PO20_2   | /path/to/molecule_info.h5 | /path/to/cloupe.cloupe | /path/to/spatial | BRCA_Proximal  | V10T06-110 | CTG_2021_075 |
|   PO20a    | /path/to/molecule_info.h5 | /path/to/cloupe.cloupe | /path/to/spatial | BRCA_Otherside | V10S21-050 | CTG_2021_099 |

In the `spaceranger aggr` function, one parameter can be adjusted is either perform a sequencing depth normalization or not before merging, which is recommended by *10XGenomics* to avoid batch effect introduced by sequencing depth. The normalization can be turned off to maximize sensitivity (keep the original amount of reads of each sample) and perform batch correction in the downstream analysis (ex. Harmony). The output is basically same as the output for a single capture area except for the feature-barcode matrix which contains tissue related barcode nucleotide sequence plus number id to distinguish same spots from different tissues/capture areas. For example, `AAACAACGAATAGTTC-1` and `AAACAACGAATAGTTC-2.` The numbering order reflects the sample order in the 'Aggregation CSV' above. 

``` bash
#' Run spaceranger on individual sample
./OVisium/SpaceRanger-2.0.1/SR_count.sh

#' Run spaceranger to aggregate all samples
./OVisium/SpaceRanger-2.0.1/SR_aggregation.sh

#' Generate a samplesheet of the spaceranger outputs for downstream analysis
./OVisium/SpaceRanger-2.0.1/infoTable.sh
```
We also have two samples from two different patients and the capture areas were manually selected in the *Loupe Browser* using the `Visium manual alignment` -> `Fiducial Alignment` and obtained individual jason files and re-run the `spaceRanger count` on fastQ analysis, and lastly generated two separated outputs instead of one.

### 2. Visium Data Analysis with Seurat

Based on the default graph-based clustering results from *Spaceranger* and *Loupe Browser*, we will need to run some batch correctionor sample integration to bring different sequencing libraries as well as the FTEs clusters into alignment. The workflow below is adapted to the *10XGenomics* [batch correction method on Visium data](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/analysis-guides/correcting-batch-effects-in-visium-data), [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) R package for [analysis of spatial datasets](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/spatial_vignette.html), [Harmony](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0619-0) and other R
packages.

#### 2.1. Workflow details

The newer version of Seurat introduces the [SCTransform](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1874-1) workflow, which is an alternative to the NormalizeData, FindVariableFeatures, ScaleData workflow. This procedure skips heuristic steps such as pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves downstream analysis such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction and differential expression.

*STutility* is an R-package with the goal of providing an easy-to-use visualization and analysis tool kit for spatial transcriptomics data. The package was developed by Ludvig Larsson and Joseph BergenstrÃ¥hle in the Genomics research group [spatialresearch.org](https://www.spatialresearch.org/) at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH).

```{r}
#' Manually Merge individual spacerange outputs instead of using the `spacerange agg`
#' Use the `infoTable` as mentioned above to merge the individuals in the same order  
./OVisium/R/Data_Preprocessing/Merge_Visium_Samples.R
```
#### 2.2. Imaging and QC
Visualize the QC matrices of individuals in the merged object including "nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "Mito.percent", "Ribo.percent" and "Hb.percent" by spatial plots and violin plots as well as overall density histogram of the merged object splited by tissue origins (fimbrial, proximal and other fimbrial). "log10FeaturesPerUMI", the overall complexity of the gene expression (novelty score) by visualizing the number of genes detected per UMI. Additionally, we also checked which genes contribute the most reads by plotting the percentage of counts per gene per spot.
```{r}
#' This script generate QC plots in the supplementary figure 3 & 4
./OVisium/R/Data_Preprocessing/Visualization_Data_Quality_Distribution.R
```

#### 2.3. Subset, filter, SCTransform and select variable features
Filter, SCTransform individual samples and merge them through *STutility*. The variable features will be identified by the SCTransform from the individuals (3000) and then combined:
```{r}
#' According to our data QC distribution, filter the spots as below before SCTransform:
#' nCount_RNA > 500 &
#' nFeature_RNA > 500 &
#' log10GenesPerUMI > 0.83 &
#' Mito.percent < 15 &
#' Ribo.percent >5 &
#' Ribo.percent < 50 
./OVisium/R/Data_Preprocessing/Subset_SCT_Merge.R

#' Output file: OVisium_SCT_merged.rds
```

Alternative, filter, SCTransform individual samples and integrate or merge them through *Seurat*. Gene symbols will be first converted to Ensembl ids. Individuals will be integrated and 3000 variable features will be selected after integration. Individuals can be also merged and individual variable features will be combined instead. The output files can be used in the deconvolution later.     
```{r}
#' According to our data distribution, filter the spots as below before SCTransform:
#' nCount_RNA > 500 &
#' nFeature_RNA > 500 &
#' log10GenesPerUMI > 0.83 &
#' Mito.percent < 15 &
#' Ribo.percent >5 &
#' Ribo.percent < 50 
./OVisium/R/Data_Preprocessing/Subset_SCT_Integrate_Seurat.R

#' Output file: OVisium_ens_SCT_integrated.rds
```

#### 2.4. PCA dimensional reduction and Harmony integration (standard seurat way)

Using the standard seurat analysis pipeline to process the data. The PCA is performed on the scale.data from the variable features. The scale.data of the SCTransform data is obtained through `GetResidual` function. The optimal number of principle components is determined by  quantitative elbowplot method. The PCA step will be applied in the previous step 2.3 right after merging. 
```{r}
./OVisium/R/Data_Preprocessing/
